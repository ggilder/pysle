## Version 3 to 4 Migration

The iterface to isle dictionaries, praattools, and pronunciationtools haven't changed so
much except for a bit of renaming.

The expected return types have completely changed however--shifting to datatypes now defined
in `phonetics.py`.

Looking over changes to the example files may help show the changes that need to be made
to get the same results.
