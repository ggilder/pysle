    "**ISLEX** (https://github.com/uiuc-sst/g2ps/tree/master/English-US) is an English pronunciation dictionary.  Each entry in ISLEX looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    islands(+island+s,nnp,nnps,nns,vbz) # ˈɑɪ . l n̩ d z #\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three components:\n",
    "- the word\n",
    "- a list containing possible parts of speech (using those defined by the Penn Treebank https://cs.nyu.edu/~grishman/jet/guide/PennPOS.html)\n",
    "- the pronunciation (rendered in IPA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet)\n",
    "\n",
    "A word can have multiple entries in the dictionary, one per pronunciation.  Here is another entry for *islands*\n",

    "> ISLEX takes about ~20 seconds to fully load into Pysle.  To make things quicker, Pysle lazy loads data--that is, data is only partially loaded until it is needed, at which point it becomes fully available. Running the first search over the ISLEX dictionary will be slow because everything needs to be loaded, but subsequent searches should be quick.  If you aren't searching but are looking for specific words, it should be very quick, even after a fresh startup."
